										Community Based Reviews</a>
								</h3>
								<p><i>React, PostgreSQL, Rust<i></p>

								<img src="images/yip.png">
								<p>Yip was my first full stack development project. I worked on it as a part of my
									Software Engineering course at UC San Diego and it laid my foundation for all my
									future projects. Our team wanted to create a more community-focused review system
									that allowed for nuanced and relevant reviews. For instance, a community, or
									“kennel” as we dubbed them could rate businesses or services by ethical measures
									like carbon emissions. We hoped that by giving users the tools to create, curate,
									and find the reviews they want to see we could prevent review censorship.
								</p>
								<p>We followed a very rigorous design process that included mapping use cases, system
									requirements, and testing. All of this documentation made the actual implementation
									of our design very straightforward. The frontend was implemented in React and this
									was where I contributed most of my effort on the project. Our backend server ran on
									Rust and managed a PostgreSQL database that stored all the profiles and review data.
									We extensively tested our system and use cases before hosting the app on AWS.

								<p><i>React Native, Node<i></p>

								<img src="images/key.webp">
								<p>This was the first project I worked on as a part of <a
										href="https://tse.ucsd.edu/">Triton Software Engineering.</a> They
									are a student-run organization at UC San Diego that creates applications for
									nonprofits. Our development team was paired with the nonprofit <a
										href="https://www.keyconservation.org/" target="_blank">Key Conservation</a> to
									help develop their app. Key Conservation had created an application that was
									effectively a social media app for conservation organizations that could connect
									them with the qualified volunteers they needed. Our job was to implement linking
									functionality to profiles and posts.</p>
								<p>Our team worked mostly in React Native to refactor and update the code that had to
									change for our functionality to be implemented. This project gave me a lot of
									experience working with an existing codebase and dealing with the challenges of
									previous design choices. A lot of the work for this project required coordinating
									with past development teams and working to understand the systems they created to
									work within them.

								<img src="images/feeding.png">
								<p>This was another project I worked on through Triton
									Software Engineering. My development team was paired up with the nonprofit <a
										href="https://feedingsandiego.org/">Feeding San Diego</a> and tasked with
									implementing a distribution app for the organization. The app was designed to be a
									hub where the organization could check the current status of their agencies and
									organize events between them.</p>
								<p>We were provided a figma mockup of the design and implemented it in React. As we
									designed the front end, we determined what database operations would be necessary
									for our pages and organized them into calls for our server. These calls were all
									handled on a node server running express that passed our agency information through
									a MongoDB database.</p>

								<h3 class="tech"> <a href="#" target="_blank">Project Kilimanjaro Health</a>
								</h3>
								<p><i>Human-Centered Design<i></p>

								<img src="images/eng.png">
								<p>This project came about through a class offered at UCSD by the Global Ties program.
									In this class, my group and I were paired with the nonprofit organization <a
										href="https://www.projectkiliforkids.org/">Project Kiliminjaro</a> (founded by
									UCSD students). Project Kiliminjaro offers educational courses in women's health,
									hygiene, and disease prevention in rural Tanzania. They needed us to create a method
									of evaluating the success of their programs so they could identify where best to
									direct their efforts. </p>
								<p>We designed a system of community kiosks that Project Kiliminjaro's field team could
									use to give to Tanzanians in the communities they were operating in. We designed an
									application for these kiosks that made use of Qualtrics to allow the organization to
									create, distribute, and analyze the data they were accumulating through their
									evaluations. Our application also was made to store the survey data offline on the
									kisok tablets so that the data could be preserved during times where the team
									operated without internet. </p>
								<p>This was a challenging project that changed my perspective on design. Our solution to
									Project Kiliminjaro's problem came from constantly redefining the problem and
									iterating on designs with them directly. It was an incredibly effective design
									process that was only possible through truly understanding the perspective of those
									that would use our solution and empathizing with their problems on a deep level.</p>

										target="_blank">Austin Animal Shelter Outcomes</a>
								</h3>
								<p><i>Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas<i></p>

								<img src="images/data.png">
								<p>In my introduction to data science class, I worked with a team that was very
									interested in how to use data analysis to help animal shelters increase adoptions
									and decrease euthanization. We found an open source dataset called
									<a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238"
										target="_blank">"austin-animal-center-outcomes.csv"</a>
									and found a wealth of data about animal shelter
									intake in Austin, TX. More crucial to our project, we had the outcome of each animal
									taken in by the shelters.</p>
								<p>We used the Pandas library for Python in a jupyter notebook to apply all of the
									machine learning and statistics we had learned in the class to our dataset. We
									explored correlations between adoption rate and unemployment to discover if Covid-19
									had a noticeable impact on adoptions. We also looked at how factors such as age,
									breed, and sex impact whether an animal is adopted or euthanized. </p>

								<h3 class="tech"> <a href="https://ncks.link" target="_blank">Personal URL Shortener</a>
								</h3>
								<p><i>HTML/CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB<i></p>

								<img src="images/url.png">
								<p>This was one of my first full stack projects. I created it after being annoyed with
									many of the free to use url shorteners on the internet. These options often lacked a
									keyword functionality or keywords I wanted were unavailable. Also, by nature of how
									many people used them, sometimes the urls they generated were not as short as I
									wanted! The natural remedy was to create my own full stack web app hosted on my own
									database where I have complete control over which urls are shortened through my
									site!</p>
								<p>By far my biggest takeaway from this project was the best way to learn new
									technologies is by doing. You can read all the Node and Express tutorials you want
									telling you how to set up requests, but it won't click until you do it with your own
									app. More than this, creating something that you want to use will be naturally
									motivating. You want to work through all the challenges in development because on
									the other side is a url shortener you can use and share with your friends!</p>

								</h3>
								<p><i>Python, MongoDB, Linux<i></p>

								<img src="images/scripts.png">
								<p>For a long time I've had my RaspberryPi lying around and collecting dust. If you
									don't know, a RaspberryPi is a fantastic little $35 computer that can run Linux. The
									possibilities for projects with one of these is endless, but I found it absolutely
									excellent for automated email sripts.</p>
								<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/nicolaswl/free-games-notifier"
										target="_blank">Python script</a> that uses the Reddit API to fetch the top
									posts
									on /r/gamedeals. In the script, I filter these posts to only include free
									promotions. I then email myself and my friends a list of these posts with links.
									Using the cron program in Linux I set this script to run at noon daily. My
									RaspberryPi just sits and gathers any free games it finds every day. Sometimes I
									even forget about it and get a surprise email from myself with free games! </p>
								<p>This project really taught me the power of having a dedicated machine to just run
									automated tasks. Since this endeavor, I have expanded the idea to run scripts that
									alert me to deals and save them into a MongoDB database so that I can identify
									price trends and look back on the previous teals the script found. My $35 machine
									has more than paid for itself with the endless cron jobs I run on it daily!</p>
