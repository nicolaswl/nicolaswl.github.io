						Design Designs Us: Part 3 | The Ethics of Design</a>
					<p>Ethics and design are deeply intertwined. Acaroglu makes this case emphatically by suggesting
						that global decisions require global conversation. Everybody should have a say in deciding
						how and if designs will affect us and our children. Do we even need or want to achieve
						technological singularity? These are tough questions that everybody has a say in. Apathy is
						a vote for the status quo.</p>

						How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind — from a Magician and Google Design Ethicist</a>
					<p>Tristan Harris, most well known for his role in Netflix’s Social Dilemma, lays out the myriad
						of ways in which our technology “hijacks” our minds. All of our technologies offer us what
						we think we want whether it be the best restaurant through Yelp, our next friend on
						Facebook, or even our next post on an endlessly scrolling Instagram feed. However, what we
						want out of our technology rarely aligns with what the technology wants out of us. Harris
						outlines this disconnect with ten eye-opening examples.</p>

					<a href="https://www.humanetech.com/technologists#principles" target="_blank">Principles Of Humane
						Technology</a>
					<p>The Center for Humane Technology is leading the way in changing tech culture and the way we
						think about the value of technology. Here, they challenge many misguided assumptions
						designers operate under when designing new technologies and suggest alternatives that
						reflect our rapidly evolving world and culture. The organization also offers a set of
						guiding principles for designers to operate under when designing technologies: a code of
						conduct for those who accept the responsibility for designs that are “increasingly shaping
						our social fabric.”</p>

					<a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/design_thinking_for_social_innovation"
						target="_blank">Design Thinking for Social Innovation</a>
					<p>This article provides a primer on human-centered design. This is the process I follow and that I
						recommend for any project. It naturally bakes empathy and ethics into the process and ensures a
						sustainable project. It is a non-linear process that usually requires constantly redefining a
						problem to truly understand the users. In this process, direct user involvement is paramount at
						every stage to understand how well your solution addresses the problems of your users.

					<a href="https://scottberkun.com/2013/ten-myths-of-innnovation/" target="_blank">The Ten Myths of
						Innovation</a>
					<p>Berkun lays out several myths related to innovation that are key to making sustainable design
						choices. I think the most significant point he makes is that every design has unintended and
						unpredictable consequences. Every design is a double-edged sword and for all the good it may
						empower the world to do, it will equally empower the worst among us. Cars, pesticides, aviation,
						and the internet all brought both unforseen improvements in our quality of life, but also
						colossal tragedies none of the designers could have foreseen.

					<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_perspective_is_everything#t-146515">Perspective
						is Everything</a>
					<p>To properly grasp a problem you have to understand what makes it problematic. Sutherland suggests
						that oftentimes the appearance and perception of a problem are what truly define it. Sometimes a
						product need only reframe a problem or the experience surrounding it rather than eliminate it
						outright. Proper solutions use the intersection of technology, psychology, and economics to
						reframe the problem with user happiness at heart.
